# PALLAM

**PALLAM** is a mobile chatbot application that provides accurate and unbiased information about Palestine’s geography and history. It is powered by a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) trained on over 20,564 Arabic question-answer pairs.

## 📱 Overview

Understanding Palestine’s geography and preserving its cultural identity is more important than ever. This project integrates machine learning and mobile development to offer a chatbot that can accurately answer questions about Palestine, from cities and landmarks to historical and demographic details.

## 🧠 Core Features

- **Custom Arabic Dataset**: 20,564 manually and semi-synthetically curated Q&A pairs.
- **Fine-tuned LLMs**: Three models evaluated — `aya-expanse-8b`, `LLaMAX 3`, and `Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3`.  
  ✅ *Final Model: Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3* for its top accuracy.
- **Instruction Fine-Tuning** with QLoRA.
- [**APIs via Hugging Face** for seamless integration.](https://huggingface.co/abulbudz/mistral-palestinian-assistant)
